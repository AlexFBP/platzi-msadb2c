# Concept proof of MSAD B2C + MSAL

The goal is to build a multi-language/framework and mini-infrastructure (docker-compose based) composed of:

- A frontend
- A CRUD API
- A MID API

With the following overall stages:

1. Create base and working infrastructure
2. Integrate with MSAL

## Requirements

- Docker
- `docker compose` (No need to install, included in last versions of Docker)

## Run demo

### Interactive

- To exit: <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>

### Background
